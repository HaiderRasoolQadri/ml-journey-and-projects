## What are Pipelines in scikit-learn?

In machine learning, a pipeline is an automated, sequential workflow that chains together multiple steps—from raw data to a deployable model—including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Pipelines standardize the ML lifecycle, making it more efficient, scalable, reproducible, and less error-prone by automating transformations and model development.

### Why use pipelines?

1. Automates workflow – Combines preprocessing and modeling into a single step.
2. Prevents data leakage – Ensures transformations are fit only on training data.
3. Simplifies hyperparameter tuning – Allows tuning preprocessing and model parameters together.
4. Cleaner, reproducible code – Easy to save, reuse, and maintain.
5. Ensures correct step order – Reduces human error in complex workflows.

In short: Pipelines make machine learning workflows safer, faster, and more organized.

###  Importance in Deployment

Pipelines are crucial for deployment because they bundle preprocessing and modeling steps into a single object, ensuring consistency and reproducibility. They apply the exact same transformations to new data as during training, preventing errors and data leakage. Deployment becomes simple—just call **pipeline.predict(new_data)**—and updating or modifying the workflow is easy. Overall, pipelines make ML models reliable, maintainable, and production-ready.
