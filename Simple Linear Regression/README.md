### What is a Simple Linear Regression Model?

Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between two variables:
1. Independent variable (X) → the predictor or input.
2. Dependent variable (y) → the outcome we want to predict.
The model assumes this relationship is approximately a straight line.

### When to Use It

- When you have one independent variable (X) and want to predict its effect on one dependent variable (y).
- When the relationship appears roughly linear.

The Equation: $\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$
Where:
y = predicted value (dependent variable)
X = independent variable
$𝛽_o$ = intercept (value of y when  𝑋=0)
$𝛽_1$= slope (how much y changes when X increases by 1)

### Example

Suppose you want to predict a student’s exam score ($\hat{y}$) based on hours studied (X).

If the regression equation is: Score=30+5×(Hours)

- The intercept (30)  means if a student studies 0 hours, the predicted score is 30.
- The slope (5) means each extra hour studied increases the score by 5 points.

### Steps in Simple Linear Regression

1. Collect data on X and Y.
2. Fit a straight line that best explains the relationship (using least squares method).
3. Use the line to make predictions or understand the strength of the relationship.
