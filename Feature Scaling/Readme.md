    "## Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work with the data, the numbers can be too big, too small, or in different ranges for example consider this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age : [23, 45, 56, 18, 42]\n",
    "- Salary : [25000, 34000, 50000, 45000, 100000]\n",
    "\n",
    "If we provide this data to a Machine Learning model it possible that that model give more importance to Salary (because of big numbers) and ignore Age (because of small numbers) and this will effect our model perfomance.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why we do Feature Scaling so that all the features get equal importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are two types of feature scaling techniques:\n",
    "1. Standardization (z-score)\n",
    "2. Normalization (MinMax Scaling)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss both in detail in next notebooks and also discuss the the effect on outliers on them."
