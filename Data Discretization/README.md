## Binning and Binarization

### 1. Binning

**Definition:** Binning (also called discretization) is the process of converting continuous numerical values into discrete intervals or bins.

**Goal:** To reduce noise or variability in the data and make patterns more visible.

**Types of binning:**

- Equal-width binning: All bins cover the same range of values.

- Equal-frequency binning: Each bin has roughly the same number of observations.

- Custom binning: You define bin ranges manually (e.g., by age groups, income brackets, etc).

### 2. Binarization

**Definition:** Binarization is the process of converting data into binary form (0s and 1s).

**Goal:** To represent categorical or numerical data in a binary (two-level) form â€” useful for machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.
